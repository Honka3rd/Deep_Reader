# document_structure Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist records completed, code-confirmed or design-confirmed tasks for the `document_structure` module.

It is used to:
- preserve module-level implementation memory
- reduce hallucination in future Codex tasks
- prevent context-window compression from losing completed work
- track future task completion explicitly

## Source Documents

- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/module-detailed-design.md`
- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/proposal.md`
- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/high-level-design.md`
- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/`

## Rules

- Only completed work is listed as checked.
- Future work must not be added unless explicitly requested.
- If a new task is added later, it must first be added unchecked.
- Once completed, it must be checked in this file.
- Uncertain items must go to `Needs Confirmation`, not the completed checklist.

## Completed Checklist

- [x] Implements hierarchy-first structured model contracts (`StructuredDocument`, chapter, section) with pure-hierarchy write defaults.
  Evidence: `Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/structured_document.py; Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/module-detailed-design.md (Architecture Constraints)`
  Notes: Root legacy mirrors are not default persistence output.

- [x] Implements hierarchy-first effective indexing helpers and section lookup paths.
  Evidence: `Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/document_hierarchy_index.py; Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/module-detailed-design.md (Key Files)`
  Notes: Effective sections derive from `chapters[].sections[]` runtime contract.

- [x] Implements hierarchy-aware artifact repository with compatibility migration support on load paths.
  Evidence: `Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/structured_document_artifact_repository.py; Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/module-detailed-design.md (Known Legacy / Compatibility Behavior)`
  Notes: Repository remains write-boundary for section/chapter/task-unit artifacts.

- [x] document governance cleanup for hierarchy-first persistence terminology
  Evidence: `Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/module-detailed-design.md (Non-Responsibilities, Architecture Constraints, Terminology Governance Audit)`; `Deep_Reflective_Reader/document_structure/structured_document.py`; `Deep_Reflective_Reader/progress.md`
  Notes: 明確分離 primary hierarchy contract 與 legacy compatibility wording，並補齊 task-layout/diagnostics ownership 邊界描述。

## Needs Confirmation

No unresolved confirmation items identified in this pass.

## Future Task Policy

New future tasks for this module must be added here first as unchecked items:

- [ ] <future task>

After implementation, the task owner must update this checklist and mark the task as completed:

- [x] <completed task>

No coding task should be considered complete unless the corresponding module checklist is updated.

## Maintenance Notes

- This checklist is module memory for completed work.
- It does not replace the module detailed design document.
- It does not replace tests and test evidence.
- It does not replace proposal/HLD decisions and governance context.
