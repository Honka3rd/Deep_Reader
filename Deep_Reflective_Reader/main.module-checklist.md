# main.py Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist records completed, code-confirmed or design-confirmed tasks for the `main.py` module.

It is used to:
- preserve module-level implementation memory
- reduce hallucination in future Codex tasks
- prevent context-window compression from losing completed work
- track future task completion explicitly

## Source Documents

- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.module-detailed-design.md`
- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.py`
- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/proposal.md`
- `Deep_Reflective_Reader/high-level-design.md`

## Rules

- Only completed work is listed as checked.
- Future work must not be added unless explicitly requested.
- If a new task is added later, it must first be added unchecked.
- Once completed, it must be checked in this file.
- Uncertain items must go to `Needs Confirmation`, not the completed checklist.

## Completed Checklist

- [x] Defines FastAPI entrypoint and route registration for prepare/ask/task-layout/summary/quiz/reparse endpoints.
  Evidence: `Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.py; Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.module-detailed-design.md (Main Responsibilities)`
  Notes: Main module is route dispatch boundary for external clients.

- [x] Maps API schemas to coordinator execution paths and response payload construction.
  Evidence: `Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.py; Deep_Reflective_Reader/api_schemas.py; Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.module-detailed-design.md (Route-to-Coordinator Mapping)`
  Notes: Main keeps request/response mapping separate from core business logic.

- [x] Implements explicit projection/mutation route boundary including manual reparse endpoint.
  Evidence: `Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.py; Deep_Reflective_Reader/main.module-detailed-design.md (Projection-Only and Mutation Boundary)`
  Notes: Task-layout remains projection path while reparse/summary/quiz are explicit mutation paths.

## Needs Confirmation

No unresolved confirmation items identified in this pass.

## Future Task Policy

New future tasks for this module must be added here first as unchecked items:

- [ ] <future task>

After implementation, the task owner must update this checklist and mark the task as completed:

- [x] <completed task>

No coding task should be considered complete unless the corresponding module checklist is updated.

## Maintenance Notes

- This checklist is module memory for completed work.
- It does not replace the module detailed design document.
- It does not replace tests and test evidence.
- It does not replace proposal/HLD decisions and governance context.
